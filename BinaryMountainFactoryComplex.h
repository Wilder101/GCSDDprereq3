/**
 * BinaryMoutainFactoryComplex -- custom mountain factory
 * 	Creates a small tree with 0-2 children per node.
 * 	This should be where you start testing your WumpusHunter
 * 	solution.
 *
 *      It's pretty simple, actually. We creat new "caves", passing
 *      the "parent" to the constructor, along with the cave's name
 *      and a short description string. We also indicate which cave
 *      has the golden scales and which cave is adjacent to that one.
